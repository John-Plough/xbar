## About OpenWeather API

The **OpenWeather API** provides access to current weather data, forecasts, and historical data from around the world. This app uses the **current weather API** to fetch data for a specified city. 

You can sign up for a free OpenWeather API key on their website:  
[OpenWeather API Signup](https://openweathermap.org/api)

Once youâ€™ve signed up, youâ€™ll receive an **API key** which is necessary to fetch weather data. This key allows your app to query the OpenWeather service and retrieve weather information such as current temperature, high and low for the day, and other related details.

- **API Endpoint**:  
  The app uses the endpoint `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=#{city}&appid=#{API_KEY}&units=imperial` to retrieve weather data for a given city.
  
- **Units**:  
  This app uses the **imperial** unit system, which gives temperature readings in **Fahrenheit**. You can change this in the API settings if you prefer Celsius.
